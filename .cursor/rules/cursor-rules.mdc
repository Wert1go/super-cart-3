# Cursor Rule: Writing Cursor Rules

## Scope
This rule applies to all files created or modified within the `.cursor/rules/` directory.

## Purpose
Ensure Cursor Rules are written in a consistent, clear, and enforceable way.
Rules without concrete examples are considered incomplete and MUST NOT be applied.

## General Principles
- Rules must be **explicit, concise, and actionable**
- Prefer **instructions over explanations**
- Avoid philosophical or speculative language
- Optimize for **predictable AI behavior**, not human readability alone

## Mandatory Structure
Every Cursor Rule MUST follow this structure.
If any required section is missing, the rule is considered invalid.

1. **Title**
   - Short and descriptive
   - Clearly states the intent of the rule

2. **Scope**
   - Explicitly state where the rule applies

3. **Intent / Purpose**
   - Why this rule exists
   - What behavior it enforces or prevents

4. **Rules**
   - Use bullet points
   - One instruction per bullet
   - Use imperative form (e.g. “Use”, “Avoid”, “Always”, “Never”)

5. **Examples (MANDATORY)**
   - Every rule MUST contain a dedicated **Examples** section
   - Examples must be **short, concrete, and unambiguous**
   - Examples must demonstrate:
     - At least one **correct** behavior
     - At least one **incorrect** behavior (when applicable)
   - Rules without examples MUST NOT be applied

6. **Constraints (optional)**
   - Hard limitations or forbidden actions
   - Only include if necessary

## Example Formatting Rules
- Clearly label examples as `Good` and `Bad`
- Examples must be realistic and minimal
- Do not explain examples — let them demonstrate behavior

## Example of a Proper Examples Section (MANDATORY REFERENCE)

This is an example of how the **Examples** section itself MUST look in any Cursor Rule.

### Examples

Good:
- Use imperative language in rules.
- Place rules in the `.cursor/rules/` directory.
- State the scope explicitly.

Bad:
- It would be nice to maybe use clearer wording.
- Rules can live anywhere in the project.
- The scope is obvious and does not need to be written.

Any rule whose Examples section does not follow this pattern is considered invalid.

## Language Rules
- Write rules **only in English**
- Use simple, unambiguous wording
- Avoid synonyms when precision matters
- Do not rely on context outside the rule text

## Style Guidelines
- No emojis
- No rhetorical questions
- No filler or motivational text
- Prefer “must” over “should” for mandatory behavior

## Maintenance
- Rules should be **small and composable**
- One rule = one responsibility
- If a rule grows too large, split it into multiple rules

## Prohibited Patterns
- Rules without an Examples section
- Examples without both Good and Bad cases
- Vague instructions (e.g. “do it nicely”, “keep it clean”)
- Conflicting rules within the same directory
- References to undocumented project knowledge

## Priority
If multiple rules conflict, the most specific rule (closest to the file location) takes precedence.
